I'm a policy data scientist bridging quantitative research and applied policy analysis.

As Co-Founder and Head of Research at the [Israeli Institute for Cultural Policy](https://www.iicp.org.il), I lead research on inequality, cultural economics, and local governance using computational methods. My MA thesis (*summa cum laude*, University of Haifa) examined political dimensions of cultural funding through quantitative analysis.

I develop open-source R packages—[rtlr](https://matanhakim.github.io/rtlr/) for RTL languages and [il.cbs.muni](https://matanhakim.github.io/il.cbs.muni/) for Israeli municipal data—and contribute to the R ecosystem, including feature development for [janitor](https://sfirke.github.io/janitor/) and proofreading [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

As a Research Fellow at the [Arlozorov Forum](https://www.arlozforum.org/), I analyze labor markets and economic policy. I've presented at conferences from the OECD to UN-HABITAT and regularly brief the Israeli Parliament on policy research.

I work in R and the tidyverse, specializing in statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research workflows.
